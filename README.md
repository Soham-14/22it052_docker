## Usage

### ES Modules in Node

We use ECMAScript Modules in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error

You can also install and setup Babel if you would like

### Env Variables

Create a .env file in then root and add the following

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = your mongodb uri
JWT_SECRET = 'abc123'
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = your paypal client id
```

### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)

```
npm install
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run

```
# Run frontend (:3000) & backend (:5000)
npm run dev

# Run backend only
npm run server
```

## Build & Deploy

```
# Create frontend prod build
cd frontend
npm run build
```

There is a Heroku postbuild script, so if you push to Heroku, no need to build manually for deployment to Heroku

### Seed Database

You can use the following commands to seed the database with some sample users and products as well as destroy all data

```
# Import data
npm run data:import

# Destroy data
npm run data:destroy
```

```
Sample User Logins

admin@example.com (Admin)
123456

john@example.com (Customer)
123456

jane@example.com (Customer)
123456
```

# Docker Architecture Diagram

![Docker Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/taufiqpsumarna/proshop_mern_dockerized/blob/master/uploads/Docker.png)

In this project we create replicas for backend and frontend each two of them, you can modified replicas count or disable it by commented out in docker-compose.yml file:

```

...
#deploy:
#      replicas: 2
...

```

# Docker Configuration

Docker instruction created by Taufiq üòÅ shout-out to @bradtraversy for the application !

``These instructions use Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701 and Docker Compose version v2.7.0 may be different approach in future if using newer version of docker engine and docker compose.``

### Pre requirerites

1. Make sure you has created .env file on this root directory, follow instruction above or use .env.example
2. You have some knowledge about Docker *just kidding you can use this repo as your learning material

# Build Docker Images

You may want to build Docker images manually or simply skip this step for using the docker image that already uploaded to my dockerhub registry

### Build Frontend Docker Images

```
cd frontend
docker build -t <your_dockerhub_username>/proshop-frontend .
```

### Build Backend Docker Images

```
cd backend
docker build -t <your_dockerhub_username>/proshop-backend .
```

# Update docker-compose.yml

### Docker Compose Frontend Services, change to your docker image name

```
...
proshop-frontend-app:
    image: <your_dockerhub_username>/proshop-frontend:latest
...
```

### Docker Compose Frontend Services, change to your docker image name

```
...
proshop-backend-app:
    image: <your_dockerhub_username>/proshop-backend:latest
...
```

# Firing up docker container

```
#Running container foreground
docker compose up 

#Running container background
docker compose up -d
```

# How To Seed Database On Backend Container

Make sure all docker container is running up then you can access the backend container like this:

```
docker ps
docker exec -it <backend-container-name> sh

# Import data
node seeder

# Destroy data
node seeder -d
```

# SSL Nginx Reverse Proxy Guide

1. Create DNS record using Public IP docker server.
2. Update server name in nginx/nginx.conf
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name {domain}; #Change with your domain or subdomain ex: shop.example.com
    ...
}
...
...
...
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name {domain};  #Change with your domain or subdomain ex: shop.example.com
}
```
3. Request new certificate
    - First you may need to remove HTTPS nginx config block in nginx/nginx.conf

    ```
    ...
    #HTTPS Access Start
    ...
    ...
    ...
    #HTTPS Access End
    ...
    ```
    - Dry run certificate request ``` docker compose run --rm  certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /var/www/certbot/ --dry-run -d {domain} ``` replace with your own domain and you should get a success message like "The dry run was successful".
    - Then run command for request new certificate ``` docker compose run --rm certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path=/var/www/certbot --email {email} --agree-tos --no-eff-email -d {domain} ``` replace with your own email and domain
    - After request new certificate we bring back HTTPS nginx config block in nginx/nginx.conf (Don't forget to change {domain} for nginx loading ssl certificates)

    ```
    ...
    #HTTPS Access Start
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/{domain}/fullchain.pem; #Replace with your domain name
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/{domain}/privkey.pem; #Replace with your domain name
    #HTTPS Access End
    ...
    ```

4. Fire up your application ``` docker-compose up -d ```

### Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have firewall allowing access to port 80 and port 443
- Check if there any typos in configuration files
- Run docker container with ``` docker-compose up ``` it make easier for debugging

# Notes

You may need to check the docker-compose.yml before start up the docker container, and look to docker architecture diagram first.

- If you need connect to mongodb just uncomment the following line in the docker-compose.yml file

```
...
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:4.4.11
    container_name: mongodb-srv
    volumes:
    - ./proshop-app-data:/data/db
    #Enable port if you need to connect the mongodb
--> #ports:          <--
--> #- "27017:27017" <--
    networks:
      - proshop-net
...
```

- If you want to deploy this application to your VPS or cloud VM, make sure you have updated the nginx.conf in the nginx folder before building or using the frontend image

```
...
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;  #Change with your domain or subdomain ex: shop.example.com
...
```
